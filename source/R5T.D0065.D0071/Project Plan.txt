R5T.D0065.D0071 - D0071 (executing assembly anchor-based service implementations library for the IExecutableFilePathProvider and IExecutableDirectoryPathProvider services.

Note, the D0071 ExecutingAssembly.IFilePathProvider service is used to provided the tradition "executable directory" path, which is the path containing all DLLs.

This is the executable directory path you usually think of when running and debugging console applications.

However, when code is run by a tool (like EF Core, or in MSTest), the entry point assembly (or first input argument to the process) is in a very different location than your DLLs.
